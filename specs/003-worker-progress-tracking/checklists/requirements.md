# Specification Quality Checklist: Worker Progress Tracking Mobile App

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-16
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

### Validation Summary

**Status**: âœ… PASSED

All checklist items have been validated and passed. The specification is complete and ready for the next phase (/.speckit.clarify or /.speckit.plan).

### Key Strengths

1. **Comprehensive User Stories**: 7 prioritized user stories with clear P1, P2, P3 priorities that are independently testable
2. **Detailed Functional Requirements**: 57 functional requirements organized into 9 logical categories with clear FR codes
3. **Measurable Success Criteria**: 14 specific, quantifiable success criteria focused on user outcomes and system performance
4. **Clear Scope**: Well-defined in-scope and out-of-scope items prevent scope creep
5. **Risk Analysis**: 6 risks identified with likelihood, impact, and detailed mitigation strategies
6. **Database Integration**: Specification aligned with actual Supabase database schema (verified via database connection)
7. **Offline-First Design**: Comprehensive offline support requirements with sync strategy
8. **Technology-Agnostic**: All requirements focus on "what" not "how"

### Notable Assumptions

- Work stages configuration with JSON fields (`required_fields` and `checklist_items`) needs to be created by admins before app launch
- Supabase infrastructure is already configured
- Workers and crews are pre-assigned to projects
- Mobile devices have minimum 2GB storage

### Dependencies to Monitor

- Supabase platform availability
- Admin web panel (separate feature) for approval workflow completion
- Mobile OS permissions (camera, GPS)

### Edge Cases Covered

- Offline/online transitions
- Session expiry during offline work
- Concurrent submissions on same segment
- GPS unavailability
- Photo upload failures
- Over-completion scenarios
- Entry editing after approval

### Ready for Next Phase

The specification is complete and comprehensive. Proceed to:
- **/.speckit.plan** - Generate implementation plan with technical design
- **/.speckit.tasks** - Generate actionable task list from the plan
