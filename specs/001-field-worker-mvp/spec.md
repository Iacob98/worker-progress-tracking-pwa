**Feature Branch**: `001-field-worker-mvp`
**Created**: 2025-10-15
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: Worker App user flow and interaction logic specification

---

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Worker Authentication & Project Access (Priority: P1) ðŸŽ¯ MVP

**Description**: As a field worker, I need to securely log into the PWA and access my assigned projects so I can start recording my daily work progress.

**Why this priority**: Authentication is the foundational capability - without it, no other functionality is accessible. This establishes secure access and loads the worker's context (projects, cabinets, segments).

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a worker account, logging in with email+PIN, and verifying that only assigned projects are visible. Delivers immediate value by enabling secure field access.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am a registered worker with email and PIN (4-6 digits), **When** I open the PWA and enter valid credentials, **Then** I am authenticated via `supabase.auth.signInWithPassword()` with PIN as password, see my assigned projects list with progress indicators, and my session (JWT + refresh token) is saved locally for offline access.

2. **Given** I enter a non-numeric PIN or PIN with wrong length, **When** I attempt to login, **Then** I see client-side validation error: "PIN must be 4-6 digits" before submission.

3. **Given** I enter an incorrect PIN, **When** I attempt to login, **Then** I see a clear error message "Invalid email or PIN" and remain on the login screen with the email field pre-filled.

4. **Given** I have failed login 5 times in a row, **When** I attempt the 6th login, **Then** my account is temporarily locked for 15 minutes with message: "Too many failed attempts. Please try again in 15 minutes."

5. **Given** I need to change my PIN, **When** I use "Forgot PIN" link, **Then** I am sent a password reset email via Supabase Auth standard flow and can set a new PIN (4-6 digits).

6. **Given** I am offline and have previously logged in with valid refresh token, **When** I open the PWA, **Then** I can access the app with my cached session and see my previously loaded data without network request.

7. **Given** I have successfully logged in, **When** the app loads my data, **Then** I see projects, cabinets (NVT), segments, work stages, and my draft entries loaded from Supabase.

8. **Given** I am logged in as a worker, **When** I view projects, **Then** I only see projects assigned to me (RLS enforced).

---

### User Story 2 - Cabinet Selection & Navigation (Priority: P1) ðŸŽ¯ MVP

**Description**: As a field worker, I need to quickly select the cabinet (NVT point) I'm working on via NFC/QR scan or manual search so I can start recording work without delays.

**Why this priority**: Cabinet selection is the entry point to all field work. Workers need fast access (â‰¤15 seconds from login to cabinet screen) to meet the 2-minute reporting goal.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by navigating to a project, scanning an NFC tag or QR code linked to a cabinet, and verifying the cabinet detail screen loads with segments and progress summary.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have selected a project, **When** I scan a QR code containing cabinet_id UUID (format: `fieldworker://cabinet/{uuid}`), **Then** app looks up cabinet from IndexedDB cache by ID and displays cabinet detail screen within 1 second with segments, houses, stages, and progress summary.

2. **Given** I scan a QR code with cabinet_id not in my local cache and I am online, **When** the lookup fails locally, **Then** app fetches cabinet from Supabase and displays detail screen or shows error "Cabinet not found."

3. **Given** I scan a QR code for a cabinet not in my assigned projects, **When** the RLS check fails, **Then** I see error: "Cabinet not in your assigned projects. Please contact your manager."

4. **Given** I have selected a project and QR scanner is unavailable, **When** I use manual search by human-readable cabinet code (e.g., "NVT-2024-0157"), **Then** I can find and open the cabinet within 3 taps.

5. **Given** I am viewing a cabinet, **When** the detail screen loads, **Then** I see segments with two remaining meters values: "Remaining (approved)" and "Pending (submitted)", completion percentages, and current stage status for each segment.

6. **Given** I am offline and scan a QR code with cabinet_id in cache, **When** lookup succeeds, **Then** I see the cabinet detail screen with locally cached data and sync indicator shows "Offline - data may be outdated".

7. **Given** I am offline and scan a QR code not in cache, **When** lookup fails, **Then** I see error: "Cabinet not cached for offline use. Please connect to internet or search manually by code."

8. **Given** QR code is damaged or contains invalid data, **When** scan fails, **Then** I see search dialog: "Cabinet not found. Please search manually." and can report issue to admin.

### User Story 3 - Record Segment Progress (Priority: P1) ðŸŽ¯ MVP

**Description**: As a field worker, I need to record progress on a segment (meters completed, photos, notes) for a specific work stage so management can track daily completion rates.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition - capturing work progress with photo proof in under 2 minutes. Without this, the app provides no business value.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by selecting a segment, choosing a work stage, entering meters, adding photos with EXIF/GPS, and submitting. Verify the entry appears in "My Entries" as "submitted" and photos upload to Supabase Storage.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am viewing a cabinet, **When** I select a segment and choose a work stage (e.g., "Excavation"), **Then** I see a dynamic form generated from `work_stages.required_fields` JSON with 4 supported field types: number (meters), text (short input), textarea (notes), and select (equipment dropdown).

2. **Given** the work stage has `required_fields` configuration, **When** the form renders, **Then** I see fields with appropriate input types, labels, validation rules (required, min/max for numbers, maxLength for text), and helper text.

3. **Given** the work stage has `checklist_items` with `required: true`, **When** I attempt to submit without checking all required items, **Then** I see red error: "Please complete all required checklist items" and submission is blocked.

4. **Given** the work stage has `checklist_items` with `required: false`, **When** I attempt to submit without checking optional items, **Then** I see yellow warning banner: "Some checklist items are incomplete" but submission is allowed.

5. **Given** I am recording progress, **When** I enter meters completed (e.g., 50), add 4 photos via camera, and include a note, **Then** photos are compressed to <2MB, EXIF/GPS data is preserved, and a draft is auto-saved every 5 seconds to local storage.

6. **Given** I have completed the form with all validations passing, **When** I click "Submit", **Then** a `progress_entry` record is created with status `submitted`, photos are uploaded to Supabase Storage with signed URLs, and the entry appears in "My Entries - Submitted".

7. **Given** I am filling the form and lose internet connection, **When** I click "Submit", **Then** the entry is queued locally with status `pending_upload`, shown in sync indicator "Syncing (1 pending)", and syncs automatically when connection returns.

8. **Given** the work stage requires minimum 2 photos (`required_photos: 2`) and I add only 1, **When** I attempt to submit, **Then** I see validation error: "This stage requires at least 2 photos. You have 1." and submission is blocked.

9. **Given** I enter meters_done (55) that exceeds approved remaining meters (50) but is within 10%, **When** I submit, **Then** I see yellow warning: "You are reporting 5m more than approved remaining (50m). Pending approval: 10m. Please verify." and can submit after confirmation.

10. **Given** I enter meters_done (65) that exceeds approved remaining meters (50) by more than 10%, **When** I attempt to submit, **Then** I see orange warning: "Over-completion >10%. Please add a comment explaining the measurement difference" and comment field becomes required.

11. **Given** segment shows "Remaining (approved): 50m" and "Pending (submitted): 30m", **When** I enter 25 meters, **Then** the UI calculates and shows: "After submission: Remaining 25m (approved), Pending 55m (submitted)" for transparency.

### User Story 4 - Handle Returned Entries (Priority: P2)

**Description**: As a field worker, I need to view entries that were returned by admin with feedback, add missing information, and resubmit so my work can be approved.

**Why this priority**: Return/correction workflow is critical for quality control but is a reactive process - workers first need to submit entries (US3) before this scenario applies. Reduces rework time from hours to minutes.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by having an admin return an entry with reason "Missing equipment photo", worker opens the returned entry, adds the photo, adds a correction comment, and resubmits. Verify status changes from `returned` â†’ `submitted`.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an admin has returned my entry with reason "Photo unclear", **When** I open "My Entries - Returned", **Then** I see the entry highlighted in orange with the admin's feedback displayed prominently.

2. **Given** I am viewing a returned entry, **When** I add missing photos or update information, **Then** I must add a "Correction Comment" field (required) explaining what was fixed.

3. **Given** I have corrected a returned entry, **When** I click "Resubmit", **Then** the status changes to `submitted`, the correction comment is stored, and the entry moves to "My Entries - Submitted".

4. **Given** I am offline and viewing returned entries, **When** I make corrections, **Then** changes are saved locally and resubmitted when connection returns.

---

### User Story 5 - Record House Appointments (Priority: P2)

**Description**: As a field worker, I need to record house connection appointments (arrival, before/after photos, completion status) so home installations are documented and tracked.

**Why this priority**: House connections are a distinct workflow from segment progress. Important for customer-facing work but independent from infrastructure progress tracking (US3).

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by selecting a house appointment from a cabinet, marking "Arrived", taking before photo, marking "Completed", taking after photo, and submitting. Verify appointment status updates and photos are stored.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am viewing a cabinet with house appointments, **When** I open the "Appointments" tab, **Then** I see a list of houses with addresses, scheduled time windows, and current status.

2. **Given** I have arrived at a house, **When** I mark "Arrived" and take a "before" photo, **Then** the appointment status updates to `in_progress` and the photo is uploaded.

3. **Given** I have completed the installation, **When** I mark "Completed" and take an "after" photo, **Then** the appointment status updates to `completed` and both photos are linked to the appointment record.

4. **Given** I cannot complete the appointment, **When** I select "Reschedule" and add a reason, **Then** the appointment status updates to `rescheduled` with my note and the admin is notified.

5. **Given** I am offline, **When** I record appointment progress, **Then** all status changes and photos are queued and synced when online.

---

### User Story 6 - View Personal Dashboard (Priority: P3)

**Description**: As a field worker, I need to see my daily/weekly KPIs (meters completed, entries submitted, returns) so I can track my performance and identify issues.

**Why this priority**: Dashboard provides valuable insights but is not required for core workflow (auth, navigate, record, submit). Nice-to-have for worker engagement and self-service performance tracking.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by logging in after submitting several entries and viewing the dashboard. Verify metrics show correct counts for today/this week, including meters done, entries by status, and return rate.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have submitted entries today, **When** I open the Dashboard, **Then** I see total meters completed today, number of entries (draft/submitted/returned/approved), and any pending actions.

2. **Given** I am viewing the Dashboard, **When** I toggle between "Today" and "This Week", **Then** metrics update to show the selected time period.

3. **Given** I have returned entries, **When** I view the Dashboard, **Then** returned entries are highlighted with a red badge showing the count and a quick link to "My Entries - Returned".

4. **Given** I am offline, **When** I open the Dashboard, **Then** I see metrics calculated from locally cached data with a note "Offline - data may be outdated".

---

### User Story 7 - Brigade Leader Entry Management (Priority: P3)

**Description**: As a brigade leader (foreman), I need to view and edit entries from all my team members so I can verify quality before submission and correct errors on behalf of workers.

**Why this priority**: Brigade leader capabilities extend the worker role but are not required for individual workers (majority of users) to function. Adds team management value but is not MVP-blocking.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by logging in as a brigade leader, viewing "Team Entries", editing another worker's draft entry, and submitting it. Verify RLS allows foreman to see team data and audit log records the foreman's action.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am logged in as a brigade leader, **When** I open "Team Entries", **Then** I see all entries from my team members grouped by worker name with status filters.

2. **Given** I am viewing a team member's draft entry, **When** I click "Edit", **Then** I can modify meters, add photos, or update notes and the audit log records my user ID as the editor.

3. **Given** I am viewing a team member's returned entry, **When** I make corrections and resubmit, **Then** the entry status changes to `submitted` and the correction is attributed to me in the audit log.

4. **Given** I am offline, **When** I edit team entries, **Then** changes are saved locally and synced when connection returns, maintaining audit trail integrity.

---

### Edge Cases

- **What happens when a worker tries to submit an entry for a segment that was just marked complete by another worker?** System shows a warning: "This segment was recently marked complete. Please verify remaining meters." Allows submission after confirmation to handle race conditions.

- **How does the system handle photo upload failures?** Photos are queued with retry logic (exponential backoff: 5s, 15s, 45s). Worker sees progress indicator "Uploading 3 of 5 photos" and can continue working. Failed uploads persist across app restarts.

- **What happens if the worker's device runs out of storage during photo capture?** System detects storage error, shows alert: "Insufficient storage. Please free up space." Entry remains as draft with photos captured so far.

- **How does the system handle concurrent edits to the same draft entry on multiple devices?** Last-write-wins with timestamp comparison. If worker edits on phone then tablet, tablet changes overwrite phone changes. Warning shown: "Draft was updated on another device".

- **What happens when GPS is unavailable or disabled?** System captures photo without GPS coordinates, stores null values for lat/long. Warning shown: "Location unavailable - enable GPS for accurate records." Entry can still be submitted.

- **How does the system handle a returned entry that was already corrected by another team member?** Worker sees banner: "This entry was corrected by [Name] on [Date]". Current user can view but cannot edit. Only latest corrector can resubmit.

- **What happens if a worker is removed from a project while offline with unsent entries?** On next sync, entries upload successfully (created before access revoked). Worker then loses access to project and sees message: "You no longer have access to this project."

- **How does the system handle NFC tags that are damaged or misassigned?** If NFC data doesn't match any cabinet in local cache, show search dialog: "Cabinet not found. Please search manually." Allow worker to report issue to admin.

## Open Questions & Clarifications Needed

1. **PIN vs OTP**: Constitution specifies "email + OTP/PIN". Spec uses PIN. Should we support both OTP (sent via email) and PIN (stored in DB)? Or PIN only for V1?

2. **Photo retention policy**: How long should photos be stored in Supabase Storage? Constitution mentions GDPR retention policies. Need specific retention period (e.g., 2 years after project completion)?

3. **NFC/QR tag assignment**: Who manages NFC/QR tag to cabinet mapping? Is this done in admin panel or during project setup? Need clarification on tag lifecycle.

4. **Team assignment logic**: How are workers assigned to projects and brigade leaders assigned to teams? Via admin panel? Need to understand user provisioning workflow.

5. **Realtime updates**: Spec mentions "Client periodically polls or uses Realtime (listen)". Should we implement Supabase Realtime subscriptions for entry status changes or use polling? Realtime adds complexity but provides instant feedback.

6. **Work stage checklist enforcement**: Constitution mentions "checklists per-stage". Should checklist items be blocking (entry cannot be submitted until all checked) or advisory (warnings only)?

7. **Cut (subdivision) handling**: Cuts are mentioned in data model but not prominently in user flows. Are cuts required for V1 or can they be deferred to V2?

8. **Admin panel scope**: Admin approval/return workflow is critical to this spec but admin panel is "separate site". Do we need to define admin panel specs now or only worker PWA APIs/data model?
